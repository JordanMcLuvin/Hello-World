\\This is a warmup C++ program because I havent touched this language in a while. 
#include<iostream>
#inlcude<stringstream>
using namespace STD;

int main()
{
int a;
  cout<< "Hello Cruel Beautiful Programming World. How many years have you been programming for?.: ";
  cin>>a;
  if (a>1) cout<< endl <<"Wow thats a pretty long time, I just started pretty much";
  else cout<< endl <<"You may not be experienced, but time fixes that. I just started pretty much";
  cout<< endl<<"The keys crackle under my fingertips, yet they feel so tender to the touch";
  return 0;
  }
